Wireload models
---------------
The wireload tables included within these timing models are FOR REFERENCE
ONLY. Wireload models are very subjective to variations due to place & route
design style, place & route tools, number of metal layers, block size, routing
density and other design specific parameters. It is strongly recommended that
users develop their own wireload models for their specific design environment
for the highest level of accuracy.

Process K-factors
-----------------
For each Synopsys library (fast, typical, slow), both the "nom_process"
variable and the "process" operating condition are set to 1. Because each
corner library was characterized using the foundry's corresponding process
models (FF for fast, TT for typical, SS for slow), it is not necessary to
further derate the process condition within Synopsys. When mixing Artisan
libraries with other vendor libraries, the Artisan process operating condition
should be set equal to the nom_process value to maintain timing accuracy.

Synopsys 1999.05 (and newer versions)
-------------------------------------
If you are using Synopsys version 1999.05 (or newer), you must uncomment these
lines from the header of the .LIB file and recompile the library:

  default_leakage_power_density : 0.0;
  slew_derate_from_library      : 1;
  slew_lower_threshold_pct_fall : 10.0;
  slew_upper_threshold_pct_fall : 90.0;
  slew_lower_threshold_pct_rise : 10.0;
  slew_upper_threshold_pct_rise : 90.0;
  input_threshold_pct_fall      : 50.0;
  input_threshold_pct_rise      : 50.0;
  output_threshold_pct_fall     : 50.0;
  output_threshold_pct_rise     : 50.0;
